# What is ansible?
That's bigger than I'm going to write about here, but what am I using it for is a better question.

I want to keep the configuration of some thigns on  machines, physical and virtual, syncronized.

Ansible depends on python, but is pretty easy to set up in a virtual machine.

The load on that virtual machine is very low if you are doing simple things on a few machines at a time.

Once installed there are helpful things like VSCode extensions to help with YAML syntax, and ansible-lint comes with the installation. 

YAML syntax is a huge pain in the a$$, but once you get going it's simple, just VERY picky.
