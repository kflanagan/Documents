# AI - Is it?

I have recentlu gone to multiple events from vendors, IBM and Red Hat mostly recently, either at work or invited because my employer is a big customer of those companies.  At these events I have seen the latest products that are labeled as AI.

# Watson AI
This is IBMs umbrella offering, the demo that I saw was a custom built chatbot that IBM built for my employer, where it was a customer service bot.  The idea is that it's focused on one product line and when the customer asks a question that's unrelated after completing the original conversation it would just scrape the public web site, give the customer a link and summary of that section.

# Ansible Lightspeed
This is the thing that I am more interested in.  It's an Ansible add-on for VSCode (Microsoft's coding editor that I'm using for this markdown doc).  You type a short sentence and it writes the task text to do a single function.
