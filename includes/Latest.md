# My latest thoughts on non-technical things

## What I'm reading and thoughts about how it relateses to the world around me

------------ 
I have just started listening to "White Trash" by Nancy Isenberg. A history of poverty among people of European ancestory. So far it's mostly focused on England and the colonies in America.  
It does remind me that for a long time there have been those who see being poor as the result of some moral failing. Multiple branches of Christianity seem to have adopted this view of the world, instead of loving your brothers and sisters and doing things for them, you should imprision or indenture them. 

-----------------
It's interesting that I just finished listening to The Man Who Broke Capitalism, a book about 
how Jack Welch turned corporate culture into the beast that it usually is now.  The only thing that matters is bumping up the share price and dividends. 
Now, FB, Google, Microsoft, Salesforce each are cutting >10k people from the payroll.  It seems that the ghost of JW lives.
