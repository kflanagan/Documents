# Planning the work, in SAFe Agile

At my employer we "practice" SAFe Agile as a way of planning our work.  We plan out the upcoming quarter's work in a 2 day marathon.  

I've been working as the Scrum Master for a small team,  while also doing technical work.  We create Features, which are bits of work that are usually mid sized things, usually done in 2 to 4 weeks, then we break those things down into Stories which are usually done in somewhere from a day to a week by a person. 

The team I'm with now hasn't done this kind of planning in the past, and has a fair sized chunk of our work that is driven by trouble tickets, and requests that come in.  The other members of the team aren't really engaged in this planning process. 

We go into PI Planning for the upcoming quarter tomorrow, it's a 2 day affair where we go in with goals, and come out with a list of things that we are going to do, how those things are related, and how long each will probably take to do, lastly, a commitment from all of the team that we are confident that we can do the work. 

I hope that the team makes the necessary changes in how they work, so that we are all successful.  We have some challenges ahead.
