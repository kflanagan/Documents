# My latest thoughts on non-technical things

## 21-Apr-2023 was the wrap of a rough week at work

I spent at least 2 full days spread over the week working to install some server software for software deployment (CI/CD) that installed just fine, but go to start the server, java based, and it won't connect to the database. Have I said today how much I loathe Java server products? 

Friday about 3:00 I started getting pings.  We were experiencing an outage of our automation platform.
What happens when you combine an application that requires that you put usernames and passwords in the configuration for multiple core pieces, with a security requirement that you manage passwords for accounts?  
The security tools will rotate passwords in Active Directory, but then it's out of sync with the one you put in the application, so big integrations with other systems just fail.  

Now it's time for the weekend!  

## What I'm reading and thoughts about how it relateses to the world around me

------------ 
I recently listening to "White Trash" by Nancy Isenberg. A history of poverty among people of European ancestory. So far it's mostly focused on England and the colonies in America.  
It does remind me that for a long time there have been those who see being poor as the result of some moral failing. Multiple branches of Christianity seem to have adopted this view of the world, instead of loving your brothers and sisters and doing things for them, you should imprision or indenture them. 

-----------------
It's interesting that I recently finished listening to The Man Who Broke Capitalism, a book about 
how Jack Welch turned corporate culture into the beast that it usually is now.  The only thing that matters is bumping up the share price and dividends. 
Now, FB, Google, Microsoft, Salesforce each are cutting >10k people from the payroll.  It seems that the ghost of JW lives.
