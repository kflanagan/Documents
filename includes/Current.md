Since github doesn't do includes, I'll have to work with the links.

## Current projects at home
I recently set up an ansible server on a Virtual machine, mostly so I could learn some Ansible things, as it may come in handy at work.  I work best when I have a thing to do that I'll want to keep around, so I decided that I was going to set this up in a way that will make setup of new Virtual machines easy to be consistent in the following ways.
- File sharing between each
- All pointing at one the physical desktop computer, in a directory that I have cloned my Testing github repo
- Exporting the same directory on all of the physical and virtual machines
- Auto mounting of some of these directories on demand on other systems

I have a mix of things at home.
- Physical Windows, Linux, ChromeOS, Android and iOS devices
- Virtual Linux, and soon Windows machines (Those run on a physical Desktop computer that runs Ubuntu Linux)
